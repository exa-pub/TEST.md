# Go implementation works correctly

```yaml
watch:
  - ./internal/**
  - ./cmd/**
```

Go code changed — verify it works correctly:
1. Go tests pass: `go test ./internal/...`
2. Build succeeds: `go build -o ./bin/ ./cmd/...`
3. Run `./testmd-go status` on a sample TEST.md and verify output is correct

# Documentation is accurate

```yaml
watch:
  - ./docs/specification.md
  - ./docs/cli.md
  - ./docs/examples.md
  - ./docs/architecture.md
  - ./README.md
```

Read through each doc and verify:
1. All documented commands actually work as described
2. All examples are copy-pasteable and produce expected output
3. No references to removed features or old behavior
4. Architecture doc matches actual module structure
